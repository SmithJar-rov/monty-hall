For this implementation, I focused on making the problem computationally efficient.  The code is very simple, and the result of the simulation can often be predicted easily based on the logic used.

Things that I might update in the future:
2. Add ASCII visualizations so you can see what's going on the simulation.
3. Add the ability to choose your own guess.
   Add the ability to choose how many winning doors there are.
