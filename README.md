For this simulation, I used C and tried to make it as computationally efficient as possible.  In retrospect, this might have been a mistake, since it makes the solution to the problem obvious to the point where running the simulation isn't even necessary.

Possible things that I might update in the future:
1. Adjust the structure of the simulation so that it better fits the "spirit" of the problem.
2. Add ASCII visualizations so you can see what's going on the simulation.
3. Add the ability to choose your own guess.
4. Add the ability to choose the number of doors Monty opens.
